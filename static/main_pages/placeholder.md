	welcome at my site!
</div>

it still needs a bit of filling in, and almost every link doesn't work yet, but I hope to
add more stuff to it as time goes.

goals:

* <s>use separate pages instead of an iframe</s> (done!)
* <s>add a light theme toggle</s> (done!)
* <s>add a readable font toggle</s> (done!)
* add a proper mobile mode
* add caching between pages
* move writings from other sites over to here
* add a games section

# Update Log

**?**: Filled in most of the sidebar links with content, and moved to using markdown
instead of pure HTML.

**Nov 30, 2024**: added theme + font switching! this goes a long way to making the site more accessible
to everyone. mobile mode next?

**Nov 28, 2024**: the new version of the site is up temporarily at rhysuki.pythonanywhere.com! I figured
it'd be easier learn to deploy a site in a controlled, free environment before I eventually move to my own domain.

**Nov 22, 2024**: moved the site to python + flask. chafing against barebones javascript/jquery for even
basic things like routing was getting to me, and I decided I just needed something easy and simple to glue it all
together.

**Nov 20, 2024**: the site is up! it uses only basic HTML, CSS and javascript, iframes and some other tricks to
work. it was a huge learning curve to go from nothing to this, even though I was already using another site as a
base.
