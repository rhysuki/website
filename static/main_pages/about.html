	hiya, my name's nikki, and also rhy. I'm a trans girl from brazil! I've jumped
	from twitter to tumblr to cohost and back quite a bit, and figured the best way
	to keep all of "me" in one place was having my own site.
	<br><br>
	I'm almost always doing some shit - usually hopping back and forth between art
	and coding - but I have almost nothing to show for it so far! I'm very bad at
	finishing projects.
	<br><br>
	I've been drawing my whole life, but only really got into pixel art at around
	2019 after playing
	<a
		href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-featuring-the-legend-of-zelda-switch/">
		Cadence of Hyrule</a>, and only really fell in love with low-spec art after toying with <a
		href="https://tic80.com/">TIC-80</a>.
	<br><br>
	when I played <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>, and later <a
		href="https://deltarune.com/">Deltarune</a>, in 2018, I fell in love with gamedev and
	game design. I taught myself Lua in 2019-ish, C# in 2020, and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
	in 2022.

<h2>some favorite things</h2>
<h3>tech</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> - a modal text editor that makes
		text work satisfyingly efficient. I use VSCode with a Vim mode for almost
		everything, including the page you're reading right now!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> - a small and powerful scripting
		language. it's the first one I learned, and I still think it's amazing for
		newcomers. it's turtles all the way down.
