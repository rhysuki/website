<h1>Update Log</h1>
<p>
	<b>Nov 30, 2024:</b> added theme + font switching! this goes a long way to making the site more accessible
	to everyone. mobile mode next?
	<br><br>
	<b>Nov 28, 2024:</b> the new version of the site is up temporarily at rhysuki.pythonanywhere.com! I figured
	it'd be easier learn to deploy a site in a controlled, free environment before I eventually move to my own domain.
	<br><br>
	<b>Nov 22, 2024:</b> moved the site to python + flask. chafing against barebones javascript/jquery for even
	basic things like routing was getting to me, and I decided I just needed something easy and simple to glue it all
	together.
	<br><br>
	<b>Nov 20, 2024:</b> the site is up! it uses only basic HTML, CSS and javascript, iframes and some other tricks to
	work. it was a huge learning curve to go from nothing to this, even though I was already using another site as a
	base.
